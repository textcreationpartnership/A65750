            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The Opportunity to be redeemed is either General, or Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular: <hi>(p. 14.)</hi> The General is all the Time of our Enjoyment of the glorious Light of the bleſſed Goſpel. <hi>(p. 15.)</hi> The Particular Opportunity five<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold. <hi>1.</hi> The Morning of our Age. <hi>(p. 22.)</hi> The well-redeeming your younger Daies will be moſt acceptable to God, <hi>(p. 24.)</hi> will make you more ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to others, and prove moſt profitable to your ſelves. <hi>(p. 26.)</hi> They that redeem the Time of their Youth, are likely to redeem their riper Years. <hi>(p. 27.)</hi> Inſtances of thoſe that have redeemed their youthful Daies. <hi>(p. 28.) 2.</hi> The Morning of the Week; the firſt Day of every Week. <hi>(p. 32.)</hi> Magiſtrates, <hi>(p. 47.)</hi> Miniſters, <hi>(p. 48.)</hi> Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>(p. 49.)</hi> Maſters <hi>(p. 50.)</hi> and Servants, <hi>(p. 52.)</hi> Poor and Rich, <hi>(p. 54.)</hi> ſhould ſtudy to redeem this Opportunity, and take heed they redeem it not by halves. <hi>(p. 55.)</hi> Our Obſervation of the Lord's-Day a good help to the Redeeming of all the ſix Daies following, both as to Temporals, and as to Spirituals: <hi>(p. 66.)</hi> and a means to prepare us to keep an eternal Sabbath in Heaven. <hi>(p. 68.)</hi> Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully redeem the Lord's-Day, and every Day after ſhew in thy Life that thou haſt redeem'd it. <hi>(p. 72. 3.</hi> The Morning of every Day; <hi>(p. 73.)</hi> That is an Opportunity of giving God the <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>beſt</hi> of our Time. <hi>(p. 74.)</hi> By redeeming the Morning, we are likely to redeem the whole Day following. <hi>(p. 76.) 4.</hi> The Society and Company of the moſt Religious and Godly: in which we have an happy Occaſion both

(2.)</hi> He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem'd the Time, to be an Example to us. <hi>(p. 233.) 2.</hi> Conſider further, that as Chriſt did once redeem the Time, to ſave us; So the Devil does daily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem the Time, to deſtroy us. <hi>(p. 236.) 3.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, how very notably many of the Saints and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God have improved and redeemed their

               <p>I. What it is to <hi>redeem</hi> the Time. The Word in the <hi>Original</hi> imports and ſignifies ſeveral things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>greek</hi> Word <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is commonly rendred <hi>redimentes,</hi> redeeming. Now to <hi>redeem</hi> Time, is properly to <hi>buy back</hi> the Time that is paſt, to regain Time formerly misſpent, to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, as it were, the Jewel of Time that has been formerly loſt. Time once let ſlip is indeed <hi>phyſical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> irrecoverable. We can never truly and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly live one Day, one Hour of our Lives over again. But in a <hi>moral</hi> Conſideration Time is accounted as regained:</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) When we ſeriouſly conſider, and<note n="[a]" place="bottom">Oportebat quidem, ſi fieri poſſet, revivere me (ut it a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quar) denuò, quod malè vixi; ſed quia hoc non poſſum, faciam recogitando, quod reoperando non poſſum. <hi>Bernard. ſerm de Cantic, Ezechiae Regis.</hi>

                  </note> weep and wall over our paſt Sins, lament and repent of all our loſt and misſpent Time, and wiſh with all our Hearts and Souls that we had ordered aright the whole Courſe of our Converſations, and lived and acted <hi>alwaies</hi> as we ought; and by condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ſelves for our old Follies, undo (as far as in us lies) whatever formerly we have ill done.</p>
               <p>And (2.) when by <hi>double Diligence,</hi> and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Care, and Endeavour, we do that in the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:102604:24"/>remaining Part of our Life, which ſhould have been in ſome good meaſure done before, and which is ordinarily work enough for a Man's whole Life: As a <hi>Traveller</hi> that has ſtaied too long by the Way, when he ſinds the Day is far ſpent, and that it is not long to Night, he puts on, and makes all haſte and ſpeed, and goes as many Miles in a few Hours as he did before in many. Or, as a <hi>Merchant</hi> who has ſuffered very great Loſſes, doubles his Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in his future Traffic, and ſo gets up his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate: in which Sence both the Traveller and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant are ſaid to redeem their Time. Thus the Chriſtian, by his <hi>Activity and Induſtry extraordinary,</hi> does, as it were, recover his loſt Time, he does in effect redeem it. To live much in a little Time, is in a manner as good, as if the very Time paſt were really lived over again: it is in ſome ſence as much as if the ſame Time were return'd into our hands, becauſe the ſame thing, which ſhould have been done in the <hi>whole courſe</hi> of our Life, is effectually done in ſome one Part of it better employed than the reſt of it.</p>
               <p>Neither is this any Encouragement to a wicked Perſon to looſe and let go the preſent Time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it may be redeem'd again after a ſort; for they that thus redeem it, muſt pay <hi>fall dear</hi> for it; and 'tis very uncertain, whether he that now lets it ſlip, ſhall ever have the happineſs to redeem it hereafter, though at the higheſt Rate that can be. That is the firſt particular, it is to <hi>buy back</hi> the Time that is paſt: and this comes neareſt to the <hi>Latin</hi> Word [<hi>redimentes</hi>] [redeeming] the Time.</p>

                  <p>We are bound in <hi>juſtice to God</hi> to do it; becauſe God has ſet a Day, not a Piece of a Day, apart for himſelf, and requires this Portion and <hi>Tribute</hi> of Time to be paied to him, who has graciouſly gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us all our Time.

                  <p>I ſhall further offer two Things to your Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, to move and provoke you to a careful and diligent Redeeming of the Lord's-day.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mot.</hi> 1. The right Redemption of the <hi>Lord's-day</hi> is an apt and likely means of redeeming the <hi>whole Week</hi> following:</p>
                  <l>Of redeeming it as to <hi>Temporals:</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Of redeeming it as to <hi>Spirituals:</hi>
                  </l>
                  <p n="1">1. As to <hi>Temporals:</hi> They that ſerve God ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely on the Lord's-day, will uſe all Diligence and good Conſcience, in their Calling and Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on the Week-day. And their Pains-taking and honeſt Dealing, is likely to bring God's Bleſſing
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:102604:55"/>on their outward Eſtates. Beſides, They that faithrully worſhip God on the Lord's-day, will ſeek to God for a Bleſſing on the Week-day: and they that ſeek it are likely to find it.</p>
                  <p>Once more; God won't be wanting to thoſe, who would not be wanting to him: God will bleſs you ſix Daies, for your Bleſſing and Serving him one whole Day in ſeven.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Our Obſervation of the Lord's-day, as it is a ſpiritual, wiſe redeeming of that ſpecial Seaſon; ſo it is <hi>a good Help to the ſpiritual Redeeming of all the ſix Daies following.</hi> The more <hi>Liberty</hi> Men allow themſelves upon the <hi>Lord's-day,</hi> the more <hi>looſe</hi> their Hearts are, and negligent of good Duties, and religious Exerciſes, all the <hi>Week after.</hi> They that pray not on the Lord's-day, will hardly ſo much as ſay a Praier all the Week long. They that hear not a Sermon on <hi>this Day,</hi> will ſearcely read a Chapter the whole Week. They that rob God of his due on the Lord's-day, will rarely deal juſtly and honeſtly with their Neighbour on the Week-day. But if we keep holy the Lord's-day, then every Week-day will have a Tincture and Savour of the Lord's-day. Our being Spiritual on the Lord's-day, will put us into a very good Frame of Heart, will awaken Principles of Conſcience, compoſe our Minds, ſix our Wills, call in and ſet in order our Aſſections: Our <hi>Sanctification</hi> of <hi>this Day</hi> will ſeaſon and <hi>ſanctify us,</hi> ſit and diſpoſe us for a cloſe and holy Walking with God all the Week after. If we attend upon God, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with him on <hi>this ſpecial Day</hi> of his own Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment; we ſhall find a <hi>ſenſible spiritual Vigour,</hi> a divine Power, and heavenly Strength, to carry us through all the Duties of the whole Week fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, relating either to God or Man. If we ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:102604:56"/>redeem the <hi>Lord's-day,</hi> the Obſervation of that Day will have a ſtrong and mighty <hi>Influence</hi> on our Lives on <hi>other Daies</hi> too: We ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to carry our ſelves after it, <hi>ſuitably</hi> to it: to live, and walk, and act continually, as thoſe that have newly, or lately enjoyed ſo bleſſed and happy an Opportunity; as thoſe that have heard of God, heard from him, ſpoken to him, had to do with him: we ſhall labour to live in <hi>purſuance</hi> of the <hi>End and Deſign,</hi> of the work and Buſineſs of the <hi>Lord's-day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mot.</hi> 2. Our <hi>Sanctification</hi> and good Improvement of the <hi>Lord's-day,</hi> will <hi>fit and prepare us</hi> to keep and enjoy a bleſſed Reſt and <hi>eternal Sabbath in Heaven.</hi> They that delight in God here, will much more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in him hereafter: and thoſe whom God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in here, he will delight in for evermore. They that keep holy the Chriſtian Sabbath here, ſhall be tranſlated and admitted to ſanctify and [ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate] an everlaſting Sabbath in Glory hereafter.</p>

                  <p>But on the <hi>other ſide;</hi> your groſs continued Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, and wilful, reſolved Profanation of the Lord's-day, will <hi>unfit and unqualify you,</hi> to keep a glorious feſtival, and a joyful, happy Holy-Day in Heaven.</p>
                  <p>God can take no Complacency and Delight in you, if you can take no Complacency in him, no Delight in his Sabbaths, no Pleaſure in his Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Service.

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:102604:56"/>worldly Labours, and ſecular Negotiations; have reaſon to <hi>fear,</hi> leſt <hi>God ſware in his Wrath, that they ſhall never enter into his Rest.</hi> They that will not <hi>rest</hi> from their Works and Pleaſures on this Day, have cauſe to conclude, that in Hell they ſhall have <hi>no Rest, neither Day nor Night.</hi> They that will do their own Works on the <hi>Lord's-day,</hi> may expect to ſuffer for their evil Deeds in the <hi>Day of the Lord.</hi> They who wilfully abſented themſelves from <hi>God's Houſe,</hi> on <hi>God's Day,</hi> have no ground to hope, that God will receive them to Communion with himſelf in his <hi>heavenly King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as God can take no <hi>delight in you;</hi> ſo, if you pollute and profane, break and violate the Lord's-Day, neglect Religion, contemn the Worſhip, and deſpiſe the Service of God; if you <hi>changed your place,</hi> you would there no more <hi>delight in God</hi> than you do here. Heaven would be a Burden, <hi>Heaven</hi> would be an <hi>Hell</hi> to the <hi>unſuitable Spirit</hi> of an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, profane, voluptuous Perſon.

You that are <hi>ſick</hi> of a <hi>Sabbath</hi> here, and long till it be over, and can't endure to think of ſpending a <hi>whole Day</hi> in Religious Exerciſes; what wilt thou do in Heaven? where there is a <hi>perpetual Sabbath</hi> to be kept for ever. Thou that <hi>hatest</hi> the <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Saints</hi> here, I wonder what thou wouldſt do in Heaven; where, next to the Fruition and Enjoyment of God in Glory, the beſt Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will be the <hi>Company and Society</hi> of the holy Angels, and of the bleſſed and glorified Saints to all Eternity.</p>

                     <hi>Our Care ſhould be</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>not to live long, but to live enough. Life is long, if it be full. What good do eighty Years do him that ſpends them all idly? ſuch a Perſon did not live, but only linger in Life; nor did he die late, but was a long Time dead. But you make your moan, that he died young and green: yet he performed the Offices of a good Citizen, a good Friend, a good Son, he was deficient in no part that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly belonged to him. Though his Age was imperfect, his Life was perfect. He liv'd, yea he was here eighty Years, unleſs you will reckon he liv'd no otherwiſe than Trees are ſaid to live.

Let us therefore praiſe him, and place him in the Number of happy Perſons, who, how little Time ſoever he enjoyed, was careful to beſtow it well. Why do you inquire how long he lived? he liv'd to the Memory and Benefit of Poſterity. As there may be a perfect Man in a leſs Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of Body, ſo there may be a perfect Life in a leſs Meaſure of Time. Do you demand what is the largest Space of Life? it is to live till we attain to Wiſdom: He that arrives to that, is come not to the longeſt End, but the greateſt.

Serious conſiderative Chriſtians do blame them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for their Loſs of Time, even in their Life-time: but they are eſpecially ſenſible of it, and exceedingly aſhamed of themſelves for it, at their Death.</head>

Stand much in aw of thy own Conſcience, which will either acquit and abſolve thee, or ſurely judg and condemn thee. <hi>Direct. (4.)</hi> If ever we would redeem the <hi>Time,</hi> we muſt live and act, and do every thing as in the <hi>ſight</hi> and preſence, and under the <hi>eye</hi> and inſpection of <hi>God.</hi> The ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of God's all-ſeeing, all-ſearching Eye, will be of excellent <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe and Advantage to us at <hi>4</hi> times eſpecially; <hi>1.</hi> Actually conſider that God ſees you, when you ordinarily <hi>viſit</hi> one another, and at any time <hi>feaſt</hi> and make merry together. <hi>2.</hi> When <hi>Buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> or <hi>Selling,</hi> remember you are manifest in God's Sight, that God ſtands by and ſees your dealings. <hi>3.</hi> Conſider this in your <hi>ſecret Retirements,</hi> and in

                  <p>The <hi>more we ſhall get of God's Grace.</hi> Grace is encreaſed by <hi>degrees:</hi> and this is the <hi>Method</hi> of the Divine Wiſdom, for God ordinarily to give out his Grace as a <hi>help</hi> and <hi>encour agement</hi> to <hi>uſefulneſs</hi> and <hi>Diligence;</hi> a <hi>Reward</hi> and Remuneration of it.
